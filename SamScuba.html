<h1>Scuba Trips</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Little Cayman</h2>
<p>In 2017, I went to Little Cayman.  I went on six dives over three days.  It was exclucively reef and wall diving</p>
<h3>Dive Site Access</h3>
<p>I dove on the south side of the island.  Sites were accessed via boats that were docked at a pier.  Dive site availability is heavily influinced by weather.
Durring my trip, the north side of the island was to dangerous to dive due to the wind direction.</p>
<h3>Rating</h3>
<p>Overall, I would give this location a nine out of ten.  The visibility was excellent and the water temperature was a constant 81 degrees.</p>
